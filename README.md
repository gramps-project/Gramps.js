# Gramps Web &ndash; Frontend

This is the repository for the frontend of [Gramps Web](https://www.grampsweb.org/), a modern web app that allows to browse and collaboratively edit a genealogical database, based on and interoperable with the <a href="https://gramps-project.org">Gramps</a> desktop application.

Gramps Web is composed of three building blocks: at its core, the [Gramps](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps) Python library that also powers the desktop application, secondly [Gramps Web API](https://github.com/gramps-project/gramps-web-api), a Python REST API server that makes a Gramps database accessible over the web, and finally the Javascript web interface, or frontend, that is developed in this repository.
